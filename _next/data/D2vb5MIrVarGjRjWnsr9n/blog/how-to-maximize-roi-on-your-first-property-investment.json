Once you know your intent, locations like Dholera and Yamuna Expressway offer affordable entry with high appreciation potential. Look for infrastructure growth, legal approvals, and demand patterns.\n\nWealthsalt helps first-time investors by simplifying documentation, offering site visits, and curating RERA-compliant plots.
