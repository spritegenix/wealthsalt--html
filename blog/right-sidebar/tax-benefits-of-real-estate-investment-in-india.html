From home loan deductions to capital gains exemptions, investors enjoy multiple tax breaks that improve overall ROI.\n\nUnder Section 80C of the Income Tax Act, principal repayment on home loans is deductible up to ₹1.5 lakh annually. Section 24(b) offers an additional ₹2 lakh on interest payments for self-occupied properties. First-time buyers even get added benefits under Section 80EE and 80EEA.\n\nMoreover, if you sell your property after 2 years of ownership, it qualifies for long-term capital gains tax with indexation benefits—significantly reducing your tax liability. Investors can reinvest in another residential property or capital gains bonds (Section 54EC) to defer taxes further. Real estate, when structured right, becomes a tax-efficient wealth engine.","shortDescription":"Explore the powerful tax benefits of investing in Indian real estate and how it can optimize your wealth-building strategy.","extraInformation":[{"title":"Section 80C \u0026 Section 24(b)","description":"These sections allow deductions on both principal and interest portions of home loan repayments—making your EMIs work for you.","hr":true},{"title":"Capital Gains Exemptions","description":"Selling after 2 years?
